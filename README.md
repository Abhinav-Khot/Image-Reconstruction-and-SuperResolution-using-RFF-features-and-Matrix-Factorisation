# Image Reconstruction and Super-Resolution using RFF Features and Matrix Factorisation

## Overview

This project focuses on image reconstruction and super-resolution using Random Fourier Features (RFF) and matrix factorisation techniques. The goal is to enhance the resolution of images and reconstruct missing parts using advanced mathematical methods.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Reconstruction-and-SuperResolution-using-RFF-features-and-Matrix-Factorisation.git
cd Image-Reconstruction-and-SuperResolution-using-RFF-features-and-Matrix-Factorisation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
